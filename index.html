			<h1>Running Up That Hill<br>(A Deal with God)</h1>
			<h3>by Kate Bush</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					It doesn't hurt me<br>
					Do you want to feel how it feels?<br> 
					Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?<br>
					Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
					You<br>
					It's you and me
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
					And if I only could<br>
					I'd make a deal with God<br>
					And I'd get him to swap our places<br>
					Be running up that road<br>
					Be running up that hill<br>
					Be running up that building<br>
					Say, if I only could, oh
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
					You don't wanna hurt me<br>
					But see how deep the bullet lies<br>
					Unaware, I'm tearing you asunder<br>
					Oh, there is thunder in our hearts<br>
					Is there so much hate for the ones we love?<br> 
					Oh, tell me, we both matter, don't we? 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
					You<br>
					It's you and me<br>
					It's you and me, won't be unhappy
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
					And if I only could<br>
					I'd make a deal with God<br>
					And I'd get him to swap our places<br>
					Be running up that road<br>
					Be running up that hill<br>
					Be running up that building<br>
					Say, if I only could, oh
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
					It's you and me<br>
					It's you and me, won't be unhappy
